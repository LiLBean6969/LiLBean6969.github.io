### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was my third favorite because I always wanted to code a game and even though it was nothing big it was still a very enjoyful experience. I was able to write a program that allowed 2 players to play a game where player one asigns it and player 2 tries to guess it under 2 attempts. This was a very fun mini game and being able to experince and play it with my friend and non computer science friends was fun too.
