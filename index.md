### CPSC 120

*Lab 4


   Lab 4 part 2 was my third favorite because I always wanted to code a game and even though it was nothing big it was still a very enjoyable experience. I was able to write a program that allowed 2 players to play a game where player 1 assigned a specific number from 1-10 and player 2 attempted to guess it under 2 attempts. This was an entertaining mini-game and being able to experience and play it with my partner and non-computer geek science friends was a fun experience too.


* Lab 5
   Lab 5 part 1 was my second favorite Lab due to the fact that I'm a big food enjoyer so this project was very relatable. It was quite the experience of being able to see how my favorite thing to do could be assisted by computer program coding. Being able to store different bread recipes was actually something that could be useful for many food fanatics like myself.


* Lab 12
   Lab 12 part 1 was my overall favorite Lab because being able to make a rainbow-like image was very interesting and cool. I've always wanted to see the background of graphic design and how it's done so this was a pleasant experience. Being able to create gifs was quite the experience and something that I and my partners really enjoyed creating.
